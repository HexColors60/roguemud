RogueMUD is my C sandbox, a chance for me to dabble in C / MUD programming and
perhaps develop a procedurally generated MUD world to run around in. I keep a
little Roguelike / indie game blog where I'll post about this if I ever do
anything with it. For now it's pretty much just SocketMud 2.4.  : )

(Yep, Wordpress. I started the blog to keep an eye on their development. ; )
